Return subsets sum to K

Given an array A of size n and an integer K, return all subsets of A which sum to K.
Subsets are of length varying from 0 to n, that contain elements of the array. But the order of elements should remain same as in the input array.
Note : The order of subsets are not important.
Input format :
